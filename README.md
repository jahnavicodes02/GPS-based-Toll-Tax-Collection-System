Transportation has become an indispensable part of our lives. Toll plazas play a crucial role in maintaining road transportation. With a significant number of vehicles at the toll plazas, it becomes necessary that services are offered with ease. Also, it is judicious that one pays toll tax according to the distance traveled on the road. To do so, we propose an ‘IoT-based smart vehicle operation monitoring and toll tax payment system’ through our project. In this project, we plan to incorporate several modules to facilitate vehicle operation monitoring and toll tax collection. Modules include vehicle operation monitoring, drink and drive detection, and GPS technology-based toll tax collection. This project has been designed for automation in toll tax collection systems using GPS technology. Toll tax will be calculated based on the distance on the road. For the drink and drive module, we plan to use an alcohol sensor, we are incorporating GPS for distance estimation and vehicle monitoring, and Bolt IoT cloud to incorporate all modules together and display user’s information.
